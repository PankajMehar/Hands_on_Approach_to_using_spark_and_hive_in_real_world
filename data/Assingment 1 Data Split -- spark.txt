### Assingment 1
Take any data set and perform a data shuffle and split the data into two parts (90/10 split for training/testing).

### Solution
using randomSplit function
weights = [.8, .2]
seed = 42 
# Use randomSplit with weights and seed
rawTrainData, rawTestData = data.randomSplit(weights, seed)

or 

val Array(training, test) = data.randomSplit(Array(0.9, 0.1))
