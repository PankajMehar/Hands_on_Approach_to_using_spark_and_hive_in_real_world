### Assignment 2

Download data from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html for year 2007

a. Write a Hive query wich imports the data and filters out all the delayed flights.
b. Write a UDF to find out the hour of departure from the field CRSDepTime
c. Write a UDF to find out the days from the nearest holiday for the date(Year, Month, DayOfMonth) fields.

Note : treat the following dates as holidays
    
holidays = [
        date(2007, 1, 1), date(2007, 1, 15), date(2007, 2, 19), date(2007, 5, 28), date(2007, 6, 7), date(2007, 7, 4), \
        date(2007, 9, 3), date(2007, 10, 8), date(2007, 11, 11), date(2007, 11, 22), date(2007, 12, 25)]

### Solution

 CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data(
    > Year INT, Month INT, DayOfMonth INT, DayOfWeek INT, DepTime STRING, CRSDepTime STRING, 
    > ArrTime timestamp, CRSArrTime timestamp, Carrier STRING, FlightNum STRING, TailNum STRING, 
    > ActualElapsedTime timestamp, CRSElapsedTime timestamp, AirTime STRING, ArrDelay STRIN, DepDelay INT,
    >  Origin STRING, Dest STRING, Distance INT, TaxiIn STRING, TaxiOut STRING, Cancelled INT, CancellationCode STRING, Diverted STRING, 
    > CarrierDelay STRING, WeatherDelay STRING, NASDelay STRING, SecurityDelay STRING, LateAircraftDelay STRING)
    > COMMENT 'Flight Data'
    > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    > FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    > STORED AS TEXTFILE
    > LOCATION '/user/username/flightdata.csv';
    
### Note the difference wrt PIG in loading data all datatypes have to be provided.

### You can store the file in other types like:

- Text file : All data are stored as raw text using the Unicode standard.

- Sequence file : The data are stored as binary key/value pairs.

- RCFile : All data are stored in a column optimized format (instead of row optimized).

- ORC : An optimized row columnar format that can significantly improve Hive performance.

- Parquet : A columnar format that provides portability to other Hadoop tools including Hive, Drill, Impala, Crunch, and Pig.


Create another table named mydata with same schema but change STORED AS TEXTFILE and remove location.

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE mydata SELECT * FROM data;

This is an easy and fast way to convert your data in parallel to columnar storage.
